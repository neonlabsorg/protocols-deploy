# Curve Core

A minimal version of all curve infrastructure for AMM in one place.

## Structure

### AMM

- Stableswap - pools for 2 tokens with similar value (1~1)
- Twocrypto - pools for 2 different tokens
- Tricrypto - pools for USD-pegged coins combined with any coins

### Helpers

- Deposit and Stake Zap - for depositing and staking LPs in one tx
- Meta Zap - for easy exchange between LP and underlying tokens
- Router - router contract for executing complicated trades using different places

### Governance

- Agent and relayer for governance from mainnet DAO
- Vault for fee receiving from pools

### Gauge

- Reward-only gauge for incentives

### Registries

- Metaregistry for AMMs
- Address provider that has all address of factories/DAO/tokens:
  - 2: "Exchange Router"
  - 4: "Fee Distributor"
  - 7: "Metaregistry"
  - 11: "TricryptoNG Factory"
  - 12: "StableswapNG Factory"
  - 13: "TwocryptoNG Factory"
  - 18: "Spot Rate Provider"
  - 19: "CRV Token"
  - 20: "Gauge Factory"
  - 21: "Ownership Admin"
  - 22: "Parameter Admin"
  - 23: "Emergency Admin"
  - 24: "CurveDAO Vault"
  - 25: "crvUSD Token"
  - 26: "Deposit and Stake Zap"
  - 27: "Stableswap Meta Zap"

## Deployment

### Set up environment

#### Env file

Put settings file ("_env_") into [settings](/deploy-curve/settingsurve/settings) directory.
[Example](/deploy-curve/settingsurve/settings/env.example). It contains RPC url for target chain.

#### Set up Python environment

Project requires Python 3.11+

Install dependencies using poetry

```
pip install poetry==1.8.3
poetry install
```

#### Chain params file

Put settings file {chain_name}.yaml into [settings/chains](/deploy-curve/settingsurve/settings/chains) directory.
[Example](/deploy-curve/settings/chains/example.yaml). It will be used for deployment.

- **network_name** - chain name
- **chain_id** - chain id
- **rollup_type** - can be _op_stack_, _arb_orbit_, _polygon_cdk_, _zksync_ or "\_". Zksync rollups currently aren't
  fully supported
- **native_wrapped_token** - address of native wrapped token (can be non-eth token)
- **dao** - params of contracts already present on chain (script will deploy x-gov contracts, CRV and crvUSD should
  be bridged using native bridges)

Integration parameters

- **layer** - chain layer (general info)
- **native_currency_symbol** - symbol of native token
- **public_rpc_url** - rpc used in UI (only public)

#### Deployment

Make sure you have funds at your account for gas at target chain.

- Export private keys to env (don't store them in file!)

```
export DEPLOYER_EOA_PRIVATE_KEY={your deployer key}
```
```
export ADMIN_EOA_PRIVATE_KEY={your admin key}
```

- Run deployment (replace chain_name with name of target chain you want to deploy - make sure you added chain config for
  this chain in previous step!)

```
python manage.py deploy all devnet/chain_config_filename.yaml
```

#### Deployment results

Upon success, script will generate deployment file with address and other info in [deployments](/deploy-curve/deploymentse/deployments) directory.
File will have the same name as chain. ABI is stored in [abi](/deploy-curve/abiloy-curve/abi) folder.
Deployments are reusable, so if something fails, it can be fixed and rerun.
**NOTE:** contracts should be verified separately on explorers like etherscan since it doesn't support Vyper contract
verification by API.


### Deploy test pools
When infra is deployed, run
```
python manage.py deploy test_pools {chain_name}
```
to deploy test tokens and pools + add liquidity and perform a swap in test pool. WARNING!: these are test tokens, don't
use mocks in production.

### Deploy NeonEVM test pools
When infra is deployed on _NeonEVM devnet_, run
```
python manage.py deploy neon_pools devnet/neon
```
to deploy test **ERC20ForSplMintable** tokens,  deploy twocryptoswap, tricryptoswap, stableswap-plain and stableswap-meta
pools, add liquidity and perform a swaps.
